# About Me

::github{repo="MarkoGordic/MarkoGordic"}

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marko GordiÄ‡, a passionate tech enthusiast from Serbia. Currently, I am a student at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad. In 2023, I proudly represented my country as a member of the Serbian Cybersecurity National Team at the ECSC.

ðŸŒ± My interests span across the vast realm of IT, with a keen focus on Cyber Security. I love learning and exploring new technologies. I actively compete in various Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions with my team, CyberHero. You can find out more about us on our [CTFtime profile](https://ctftime.org/team/).

ðŸ’» Proficient in several programming languages and technologies, I am well-versed in Rust, C, C++, C#, .NET, Java, Python, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Flask, Django, NodeJS, Express, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, PowerShell, and ShellScript.

ðŸŽ§ When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy listening to music. Last year, I racked up an impressive 150k minutes on Spotify.
